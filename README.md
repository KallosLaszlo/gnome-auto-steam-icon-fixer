# auto-steam-icon-fixer

## Overview
The `auto-steam-icon-fixer` is a Bash script designed to automate the process of fixing Steam desktop files. It specifically addresses the issue of missing `StartupWMClass` fields in `.desktop` files generated by Steam. This script utilizes `inotify-tools` to monitor the applications directory for any new or modified files and automatically patches them as needed.

## Features
- Installs `inotify-tools` if not already present.
- Monitors the Steam applications directory for changes.
- Automatically adds the `StartupWMClass` field to `.desktop` files that contain Steam icons.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/KallosLaszlo/gnome-auto-steam-icon-fixer.git
   cd gnome-auto-steam-icon-fixer
   ```

2. Make the script executable:
   ```
   chmod +x scripts/auto_steam_icon_fixer.sh
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```
   ./scripts/auto_steam_icon_fixer.sh
   ```

## Usage
Once the script is executed, it will set up a systemd service that monitors the `~/.local/share/applications/` directory. Whenever a new `.desktop` file is created or modified, the script will automatically check for the presence of a Steam icon and add the appropriate `StartupWMClass` field if it is missing.
